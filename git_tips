I keep two branches: 
  latest
  master

I have to remotes: (git remote -vv)
  kitware
  origin

I let "latest" branch to keep track of kitware, and "master" to track origin:
  git branch --set-upstream-to=kitware/master latest
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

I can update the "latest" branch by switching to that branch and use a "git pull."

I can merge my "master" branch to whatever is updated from "latest" branch:
  git merge latest

Set a remote for current branch:
  git branch -u kitware/master

Fetch objects from a remote:
  git fetch kitware
