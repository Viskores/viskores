# Time-varying "oscillator" source-filter and example

The oscillator is a simple analytical source of time-varying data.
It provides a function value at each point of a uniform grid that
is computed as a sum of Gaussian kernels â€” each with a specified
position, amplitude, frequency, and phase.

The example (in `examples/oscillator`) generates volumetric Cinema
datasets that can be viewed in a web browser with [ArcticViewer][].
