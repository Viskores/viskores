# `SurfaceNormals` filter can now orient normals.

The `OrientNormals` worklet has been added to the `SurfaceNormals` filter, and
is enabled by turning on the `AutoOrientNormals` option. This feature ensures
that all normals generated by the filter will point out of the dataset (or
inward if the `FlipNormals` option is true). In addition,
`SurfaceNormals` now has a `Consistency` option that forces all triangle
windings to be consistent with the cell normal direction (the cell points are
specified in counter-clockwise order around the normal).

This functionality is provided by the following new worklets:

* OrientNormals
    * RunOrientCellNormals
    * RunOrientPointNormals
    * RunOrientPointAndCellNormals
    * RunFlipNormals
* TriangleWinding
