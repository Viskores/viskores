## Spline evaluation on structured grids

Viskores now supports interpolation of scalar data on structured grids through two new classes:
viskores::cont::SplineEvaluateUniformGrid for uniform grids;
viskores::cont::SplineEvaluateRectilinearGrid for rectilinear grids.

Both classes implement Catmullâ€“Rom spline interpolation, providing smooth and accurate evaluation of scalar values.
