## Update Viskores to use C++17

We have bumped up the minimum required version of Viskores to be C++17. Viskores
should also work on newer C++ versions, but this is not extensively tested.

Note that Kokkos has moved to requiring C++20. Compiling the Kokkos driver will
require that minimum compiler.
