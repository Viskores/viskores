# When this file is run by CMake through the find_package command, the
# following targets will exist:
#   vtkm_cont       Target that contains most of VTK-m
#
#   vtkm_rendering  Target that contains all the rendering code
#
#   vtkm::tbb       Target that contains tbb related link information
#                   implicitly linked to by `vtkm_cont` if tbb is enabled
#
#   vtkm::openmp    Target that contains openmp related link information
#                   implicitly linked to by `vtkm_cont` if openmp is enabled
#
#   vtkm::cuda      Target that contains cuda related link information
#                   implicitly linked to by `vtkm_cont` if cuda is enabled
#
# The following local variables will also be defined:
#
#  VTKm_VERSION         Holds the version string of "Major.Minor"
#  VTKm_VERSION_FULL    Holds the version string of "Major.Minor.Patch.GitSha1"
#  VTKm_VERSION_MAJOR   Holds just the major version number
#  VTKm_VERSION_MINOR   Holds just the minor version number
#  VTKm_VERSION_PATCH   Holds just the patch version number
#
#  VTKm_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS     Will be enabled if VTK-m was built shared/dynamic
#  VTKm_ENABLE_CUDA           Will be enabled if VTK-m was built with CUDA support
#  VTKm_ENABLE_TBB            Will be enabled if VTK-m was built with TBB support
#  VTKm_ENABLE_OPENMP         Will be enabled if VTK-m was built with OpenMP support
#  VTKm_ENABLE_MPI            Will be enabled if VTK-m was built with MPI support
#  VTKm_ENABLE_RENDERING      Will be enabled if VTK-m was built with rendering support
#  VTKm_ENABLE_GL_CONTEXT     Will be enabled if VTK-m rendering was built with a GL context
#  VTKm_ENABLE_OSMESA_CONTEXT Will be enabled if VTK-m rendering was built with a osmesa context
#  VTKm_ENABLE_EGL_CONTEXT    Will be enabled if VTK-m rendering was built with a EGL context
