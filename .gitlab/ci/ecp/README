`.gitlab-ci-ecp.yml` allows for VTK-m to run CI on provided by ECP at NMC.

To have this work properly you will need to make sure that the gitlab repository
has been updated to this non-standard yaml file location
( "Settings" -> "CI/CD" -> "General pipelines" -> "Custom CI configuration path").

The ECP CI is setup to verify VTK-m mainly on Power9 hardware as that currently is
missing from VTK-m standard CI infrastructure.

Currently we verify Power9 support with `cuda` and `openmp` builders. The `cuda` builder
is setup to use the default cuda SDK on the machine and the required `c++` compiler which
currently is `gcc-4.8.5`. The `openmp` builder is setup to use the newest `c++` compiler provided
on the machine so that we maximimze compiler coverage.

Currently the largest outstanding issue is that these builders don't report back to the
VTK-m CDash instance.
