# Viskores #

Viskores is a toolkit of scientific visualization algorithms for emerging
processor architectures. Viskores supports the fine-grained concurrency for
data analysis and visualization algorithms required to drive extreme scale
computing by providing abstract models for data and execution that can be
applied to a variety of algorithms across many different processor
architectures.

## Technical Charter

See the [technical charter] and [governance] document for the structure of
the project.

## Learning Resources ##

  + A high-level overview is given in the IEEE Vis talk "[Viskores:
    Accelerating the Visualization Toolkit for Massively Threaded
    Architectures][Viskores Overview]."

  + The [Viskores Users Guide] provides extensive documentation. It is broken
    into multiple parts for learning and references at multiple different
    levels.
      + "Part 1: Getting Started" provides the introductory instruction for
        building Viskores and using its high-level features.
      + "Part 2: Using Viskores" covers the core fundamental components of
        Viskores including data model, worklets, and filters.
      + "Part 3: Developing with Viskores" covers how to develop new worklets
        and filters.
      + "Part 4: Advanced Development" covers topics such as new worklet
        types and custom device adapters.

  + A practical [Viskores Tutorial] based in what users want to accomplish with
    Viskores:
      + Building Viskores and using existing Viskores data structures and filters.
      + Algorithm development with Viskores.
      + Writing new Viskores filters.

  + Community discussion takes place on the [Viskores users discussion].

  + Doxygen-generated reference documentation is available for the tip of the
    release branch at [Viskores Doxygen latest]

## Dependencies ##

Viskores Requires:

  + C++14 Compiler. Viskores has been confirmed to work with the following
      + GCC 5.4+
      + Clang 5.0+
      + XCode 5.0+
      + MSVC 2015+
      + Intel 17.0.4+
  + [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/)
      + CMake 3.15+
      + CMake 3.24+ (for ROCM+THRUST support)

Optional dependencies are:

  + Kokkos Device Adapter
      + [Kokkos](https://kokkos.github.io/) 3.7+
      + CXX env variable or CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER should be set to
        hipcc when using Kokkos device adapter with HIP (ROCM>=6).
  + CUDA Device Adapter
      + [Cuda Toolkit 9.2, >= 10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
      + Note CUDA >= 10.2 is required on Windows
  + TBB Device Adapter
      + [TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)
  + OpenMP Device Adapter
      + Requires a compiler that supports OpenMP >= 4.0.
  + OpenGL Rendering
      + The rendering module contains multiple rendering implementations
        including standalone rendering code. The rendering module also
        includes (optionally built) OpenGL rendering classes.
      + The OpenGL rendering classes require that you have a extension
        binding library and one rendering library. A windowing library is
        not needed except for some optional tests.
  + Extension Binding
      + [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  + On Screen Rendering
      + OpenGL Driver
      + Mesa Driver
  + On Screen Rendering Tests
      + [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)
      + [GLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
  + Headless Rendering

      + CMake 3.12
      + TBB 2018


## Building ##

Viskores supports all major platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX), and uses CMake
to generate all the build rules for the project. The Viskores source code is
available from the [Viskores download page] or by directly cloning the [Viskores
git repository].

The basic procedure for building Viskores is to unpack the source, create a
build directory, run CMake in that build directory (pointing to the source)
and then build. Here are some example *nix commands for the process
(individual commands may vary).

```sh
$ tar xvzf ~/Downloads/viskores-v2.0.0.tar.gz
$ mkdir viskores-build
$ cd viskores-build
$ cmake-gui ../viskores-v2.0.0
$ cmake --build -j .              # Runs make (or other build program)
```

A more detailed description of building Viskores is available in the [Viskores
Users Guide].


## Example ##

The Viskores source distribution includes a number of examples. The goal of the
Viskores examples is to illustrate specific Viskores concepts in a consistent and
simple format. However, these examples cover only a small portion of the
capabilities of Viskores.

A simple starting example is [Demo.cxx](examples/demo/Demo.cxx), which can be
found in the [examples/demo](examples/demo) directory. It also comes with a
sample [CMakeLists.txt](examples/demo/CMakeLists.txt) for configuring such a
project. When learning to create your own code, both the [Viskores Tutorial] and
[Viskores Users Guide] have many examples to get you started.
