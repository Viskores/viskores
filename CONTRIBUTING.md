We are currently in the process of adopting software from [VTK-m]. During
this transitional period, we have no formal method of accepting
contributions outside of our core contributors. For the time being, new
contributions should be directed at the [VTK-m] project.

When Viskores is ready to accept its own features, the contributing process
will be similar to [that of
VTK-m's](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk-m/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The author of all contributions must agree to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin] sign-off. Any developer who submits a contribution to Viskores
implicitly agrees to these conditions. That said, contributors remain as
the copyright holder for independent works of authorship and that no
contributor or copyright holder will be required to assign copyrights to
Viskores.

See the [governance document] for specifics on the management and decision
making of the Viskores project.
