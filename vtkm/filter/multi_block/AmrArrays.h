/// @brief Generate arrays describing the AMR structure in a partitioned data set.
///
/// AMR grids are represented by `vtkm::cont::PartitionedDataSet`, but this class
/// does not explicitly store the hierarchical structure of the mesh refinement.
/// This hierarchical arrangement needs to be captured in fields that describe
/// where blocks reside in the hierarchy. This filter analyses the arrangement
/// of partitions in a `vtkm::cont::PartitionedDataSet` and generates the following
/// field arrays.
///
/// - `vtkAmrLevel` The AMR level at which the partition resides (with 0 being the
///   most coarse level). All the values for a particular partition are set to the
///   same value.
/// - `vtkAmrIndex` A unique identifier for each partition of a particular level.
///   Each partition of the same level will have a unique index, but the indices
///   will repeat across levels. All the values for a particular partition are set
///   to the same value.
/// - `vtkCompositeIndex` A unique identifier for each partition. This index is the
///   same as the index used for the partition in the containing
///   `vtkm::cont::PartitionedDataSet`. All the values for a particular partition are
///   set to the same value.
/// - `vtkGhostType` It is common for refinement levels in an AMR structure to
///   overlap more coarse grids. In this case, the overlapped coarse cells have
///   invalid data. The vtkGhostType field will track which cells are overlapped
///   and should be ignored. This array will have a 0 value for all valid cells and
///   a non-zero value for all invalid cells. (Specifically, if the bit specified by
///   `vtkm::CellClassification::BLANKED` is set, then the cell is overlapped with a
///   cell in a finer level.)
///
/// These arrays are stored as cell fields in the partitions.
///
/// This filter only operates on partitioned data sets where all the partitions
/// have cell sets of type `vtkm::cont::CellSetStructured`. This is characteristic
/// of AMR data sets.
