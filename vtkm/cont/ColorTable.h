/// \brief Color Table for coloring arbitrary fields
///
///
/// The vtkm::cont::ColorTable allows for color mapping in RGB or HSV space and
/// uses a piecewise hermite functions to allow opacity interpolation that can be
/// piecewise constant, piecewise linear, or somewhere in-between
/// (a modified piecewise hermite function that squishes the function
/// according to a sharpness parameter).
///
/// For colors interpolation is handled using a piecewise linear function.
///
/// For opacity we define a piecewise function mapping. This mapping allows the addition
/// of control points, and allows the user to control the function between
/// the control points. A piecewise hermite curve is used between control
/// points, based on the sharpness and midpoint parameters. A sharpness of
/// 0 yields a piecewise linear function and a sharpness of 1 yields a
/// piecewise constant function. The midpoint is the normalized distance
/// between control points at which the curve reaches the median Y value.
/// The midpoint and sharpness values specified when adding a node are used
/// to control the transition to the next node with the last node's values being
/// ignored.
///
/// When adding opacity nodes without an explicit midpoint and sharpness we
/// will default to to Midpoint = 0.5 (halfway between the control points) and
/// Sharpness = 0.0 (linear).
///
/// ColorTable also contains which ColorSpace should be used for interpolation
/// Currently the valid ColorSpaces are:
/// - RGB
/// - HSV
/// - HSV_WRAP
/// - LAB
/// - Diverging
///
/// In HSV_WRAP mode, it will take the shortest path
/// in Hue (going back through 0 if that is the shortest way around the hue
/// circle) whereas HSV will not go through 0 (in order the
/// match the current functionality of vtkLookupTable). In Lab mode,
/// it will take the shortest path in the Lab color space with respect to the
/// CIE Delta E 2000 color distance measure. Diverging is a special
/// mode where colors will pass through white when interpolating between two
/// saturated colors.
///
/// To map a field from a vtkm::cont::DataSet through the color and opacity transfer
/// functions and into a RGB or RGBA array you should use vtkm::filter::FieldToColor.
