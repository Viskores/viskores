/// \brief Class that manages the transfer of data between control and execution.
///
/// This templated class provides a mechanism (used by the ArrayHandle) to
/// transfer data from the control environment to the execution environment and
/// back. The interface for ArrayTransfer is nearly identical to that of
/// ArrayManagerExecution and the default implementation simply delegates all
/// calls to that class.
///
/// The primary motivation for having a separate class is that the
/// ArrayManagerExecution is meant to be specialized for each device adapter
/// whereas the ArrayTransfer is meant to be specialized for each storage type
/// (or specific combination of storage and device adapter). Thus, transfers
/// for most storage tyeps will be delegated through the ArrayManagerExecution,
/// but some storage types, like implicit storage, will be specialized to
/// transfer through a different path.
