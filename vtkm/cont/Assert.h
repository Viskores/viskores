/// Asserts that \a condition resolves to true.  If \a condition is false,
/// then an error is raised.  This macro is meant to work in the VTKm control
/// environment and throws an ErrorControlAssert object on failure.
///
/// Like the POSIX assert macro, the check will be removed when compiling
/// in non-debug mode (specifically when NDEBUG is defined), so be prepared
/// for the possibility that the condition is never evaluated.
///
/// VTKM_ASSERT_CONT will also be removed when compiling for CUDA devices.
/// Technically speaking, this macro should not be used in methods targeted for
/// CUDA devices since they run in the execution environment and this is for
/// the control environment. However, it is often convenient to have an assert
/// in a method that is to run in either control or execution environment, so
/// we go ahead and let you declare the assert there as well.
