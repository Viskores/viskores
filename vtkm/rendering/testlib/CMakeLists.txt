# Headers, which are used by tests all over VTK-m, are expected to be in the
# testing directory where tests are located. We could move things around so
# that this module is built in the testing directory and the tests are created
# somewhere else, which would also be confusing to developers trying to add
# tests. This seems like the least confusing option.
